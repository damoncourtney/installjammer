<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>1.2.13 (July 7th, 2009)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>This release contains minor bug fixes and enhancements.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Minor Bug Fixes</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fix a bug in the Ask Yes or No condition that would cause an error in silent mode.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where clicking in the virtual text table could sometimes jump to another part of the table if another field was already being edited.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Made some general bug fixes and behavior tweaks to the virtual text table.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where a modal dialog (like the conditions editor) could end up outside of the viewing area when switching from larger to smaller monitors.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Create Windows Service action where an error would occur when installing a Shared Process service.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the .installjammer directory was being created on startup when it didn't need to be.&nbsp; This would cause some command-line builds to fail when built by a user who doesn't have a home directory.&nbsp; The directory is now created only when the builder goes to save its preference settings.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in Message Box and Message Panel that would allow them to execute in a console or silent install and then throw an error.&nbsp; These actions will no longer execute in a console or silent install.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where InstallJammer would attempt to load any *.msg file sitting next to the project file when loading the project.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where using the keyboard to navigate setup types would not change the description as one was selected.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the SetActiveSetupType API call would not change the active setup type selected on the screen if the Setup Type pane was visible.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug that would cause shortcuts not to work on Asian versions of Windows.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where failing to load a project would corrupt the builder and require it to be restarted to load another project.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the uninstaller would remove ALL environment variables added by an installer on UNIX, even the ones marked not to be removed.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the uninstaller would not properly default to the language chosen during installation for some of the available languages.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Changed the way the uninstall handles the deletion of the uninstaller itself.&nbsp; The uninstaller now gets renamed into the temp directory instead of launching a copy of itself.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Replace the restart of the gnome-panel.&nbsp; Some versions of the panel still require a restart to pick up menu changes, and until I can determine what versions need it and what don't, we'll err on the side of just doing it.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where zip and tar archives weren't picking up any files during a build.&nbsp; Also cleaned up when and how a refresh of the file groups is done so that it isn't done redundantly.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the uninstall would default to the system language when it should keep the language used during installation.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where newer Gnome terminals would ignore more than one command when executing an external action in a console.&nbsp; Any command executed in a console is now stored in a file and then executed as a script.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug from beta 1 where command-line arguments in the builder were being ignored when testing on Windows.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where several APIs would cause an error if executed in silent mode.&nbsp; These APIs are now restricted to GUI-only code.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where recursive directory links could cause an infinite loop in the builder.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where opening an explorer windows on UNIX platforms could fail.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the /installkitvfs directory would show up in choose file and directory dialogs.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the Select Destination pane would not properly substitute the destination label when updating the pane.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Installing UNIX shortcuts as root will not install them for all users and not for the root user.&nbsp; This does not count for desktop icons, only for program folders and shortcuts.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Removed the code to restart the gnome-panel on Gnome desktops.&nbsp; It seems like the panel will automatically pick up the changes on its own now.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the default system language was not getting picked up properly on some Windows systems.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug with the choose directory dialog on Vista where it was still looking for My Documents even though Vista just calls it Documents.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where trying to launch explorer in a directory on Vista would just open the explorer to the My Computer screen.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where tar and zip archives did not auto refresh files when the Refresh File List Before Building preference was turned on.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Create File Link action where it would fail on UNIX systems if the link target did not already exist.&nbsp; This will remain a requirement for Windows platforms however.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Execute External Program action where the Progressive Output Widget could not be found when the action was nested in an action group.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Cleaned up all of the message catalogs to remove double spaces when displaying text in some panes.&nbsp; These extra spaces were part of the actual message catalog and not a bug in the installers.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where some actions (like WriteTextToFile) that log files would error out when running inside of an uninstaller.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where editing some text fields would not cause the project to become modified.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where setting Windows file attributes on a non-Windows platform would then cause an error during installation.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Platform Condition where not all platforms were available.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Execute External Program action where watching for output to the Status virtual text could cause an infinite loop error.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where Uninstall Leftover Files was failing on console installs.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where actions after a Move Forward or Move to Pane action would still be executed when they should be skipped.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where icons and menus were not being properly removed during uninstall on the Linux platform.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug that broke solid compression builds on all platforms.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where using an install password would fail due to a missing function.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug when running multiple installers and closing a child installer would delete the temporary directory out from under the parent.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Locate Java Runtime action where it would attempt to prompt the user with a dialog in a console install.&nbsp; For now, there is no prompt for the user in a console install, it is simply ignored.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the Modify Widget action could end up clearing a text widget even if no text was specified.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where a file group's size was not accurate when following</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where tar and zip archives with no files would error with a big, ugly error message.&nbsp; It's a little more graceful now.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where upgrade installers were not being included as part of the original install during uninstall because of a mismatch in the registry info.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed several bugs related to installers running under WINE.&nbsp; Installers and uninstallers should now run successfully under WINE.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in the Reboot or Shutdown System action for UNIX systems where no time was specified.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in uninstall on HP-UX.&nbsp; All platforms now perform the same uninstall that was previously reserved for Windows.&nbsp; Which is to say that the uninstaller is copied off to a temporary location before executing it so that the original uninstaller can be deleted in place.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug that would affect launching installers that launch other installers where the child installer would delete the temporary directory out from under the parent, leaving the parent to error out.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where creating desktop shortcuts on Linux Gnome desktops would fail if the desktop directory was not called Desktop, as it is on non-English systems.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the uninstall on Windows would leave a hanging process after exiting.&nbsp; This would cause problems when the uninstaller was called from some other program.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in message dialogs where the X button on the window would do nothing.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug in message dialogs where the initial focus button was not correct.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where editing a virtual text string from the editor would not save when the editor closed.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the Launch Web Browser action would not work properly on some versions of Windows.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where passing /version to an uninstaller would cause an error.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the UNIX permissions were being flipped in the builder.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Minor Enhancements</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Cleaned up the --help output a little bit for a more UNIX-y style.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Made some changes to the progress output during a console install (thanks to C. W. for the tips).&nbsp; It should be a lot cleaner now and look a little nicer.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added Lithuanian translations (thanks to Jonas Jasas!).</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Moved the debug log in the builder to a --debug-log command-line option that is disabled by default.&nbsp; We only need the debugging when something is broken in the builder, so we don't need to do it on every startup.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added the ability to span multiple discs using build separate archives.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a debug option for uninstallers for new projects.</span></li>

<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new Ignore Files and Ignore Directories project preferences.&nbsp; These two properties allow a project to specify patterns of files and directories to ignore when searching the filesystem.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Follow Directory Links property to file groups.&nbsp; This matches the Follow File Links property but for directories instead of files.&nbsp; The default is Yes for backward compatibility.</span></li>

<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new LanguageAPI API call.</span></li>

<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Use Uncompressed Binaries option to the Windows platform.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new RequireAdministratorText virtual text to the English message catalog.&nbsp; This message will appear when the user doesn't have the required administrator privileges.</span></li>

<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new ConfigAPI API call to configure internal settings.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the system language might not get used even when the message catalog is compiled into the installer.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Default To System Language install feature to specify that the default language on the installing system should be used if it exists within the installer's message catalog.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Default Language will be used.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new permissions to the File Permission Condition.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new &lt;%ErrorFiles%&gt; and &lt;%ErrorDirs%&gt; virtual text that are set during uninstallation when it fails to remove files or directories.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>In most properties, widgets can now be specified as &lt;pane&gt;.&lt;widget&gt; to specify exactly which pane and widget is meant.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Install UNIX Program Folder action to allow creating program folders with more options like icons.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new "matches" and "does not match" operators to the Platform Condition.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added the ability to enable response files for installers.&nbsp; Response files let a user save their responses from an install and replay them in another install later.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Enable Response Files install feature.&nbsp; This will be true by default in projects using version 1.2.13 and higher.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Add Response File Info action to enable adding virtual text to a response file when they are enabled.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Made the SelectedComponents virtual text writable.&nbsp; Whenever this virtual text is changed, it will overwrite the current set of selected components.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new ComponentAPI API call.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new CommandLineAPI API call.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new ResponseFileAPI API call.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Disable / Revert Wow64 Redirection and action to disable Windows 64 bit filesystem redirection.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Locate Java Runtime action now includes a full version number in the &lt;%JavaAvailableVersions%&gt; virtual text.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new &lt;%JavaVersionMinor%&gt; that is set by the Locate Java Runtime action.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Locate Java Runtime action now substitutes virtual text properly in the search path.&nbsp; Also added some debugging to see where the action is looking for Java on the system.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Locate Java Runtime action now handles Java versions properly, so you can use a version like 1.6.0_10 as a minimum or maximum.&nbsp; Previously, the version after the _ was invalid.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Vendor ID to the UNIX shortcut actions to allow for shortcuts to be grouped together under a particular vendor.&nbsp; This makes it easy for multiple installers to create shortcuts in the same program folders.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Focus on Widget action should now work for built-in widgets as well, not just ones added with an Add Widget action.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Save Files property to file groups and directories to allow for finer-grained access to the Save Only Toplevel Directories project preference.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Application ID property to the Get Previous Install Info action.</span></li>

<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new --build-log-file command-line option to the install builder.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Doing a full build (not quick) now automatically jumps to the build screen before the build begins to show the log.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Modify Widget action should now properly handle textboxes when modifying the text property.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new DestroyWidget API call.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Destroy Widget action can now take a list of widgets separated by ;.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>InstallDirSuffix can now contain more than a single directory, and the whole string will be joined with the InstallDir anytime it is changed.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Selectable property to Components that, if false, will turn a component in the component tree into a header with no check or radio button.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added NONE as an option for buttons on a pane.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Made the text in the language selection dialog part of the English message catalog instead of a hard-coded value.</span><span class=rvts1></span></li>
</ul>
